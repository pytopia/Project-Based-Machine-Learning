    "`Indexing` refers to the process of accessing a **single element or a group of elements** in an array by specifying their index or indices. In NumPy, indexing an array is done using square brackets `[]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  \n",
    "NumPy basic slicing creates a view instead of a copy as in the case of built-in Python sequences such as string, tuple and list. Care must be taken when extracting a small portion from a large array which becomes useless after the extraction, because the small portion extracted contains a reference to the large original array whose memory will not be released until all arrays derived from it are garbage-collected. In such cases an explicit copy() is recommended."

    "- **Boolean array indexing**: This type of indexing is used when you want to select elements in an array based on a Boolean mask. The mask is an array of the same shape as the original array, where each element is either True or False. When you index an array with a Boolean mask, the resulting array contains only the elements where the corresponding value in the mask is True. \n",
